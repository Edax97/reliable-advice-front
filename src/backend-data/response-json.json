      "detailed_review": "The claim that cells in a Petri dish explode when exposed to tap water highlights a key difference between in vitro and in vivo environments. While not directly verified, the concept is plausible due to osmotic pressure differences affecting cells outside physiological conditions. This underscores the complexity and non-equivalence of Petri dish studies to human biology.",
